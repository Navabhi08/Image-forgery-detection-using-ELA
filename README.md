# Image-forgery-detection-using-ELA
• Developed a Python Script for passive image forgery detection using the Error Level Analysis(ELA) algorithm.
• Reviewed the research paper titled Passive Image Forgery Detection Based on the Demosaicing Algorithm and JPEG
Compression’ published by IEEE and learnt about various forgery detection techniques such as ELA and CFA.
• Implemented the Error Level Analysis Detection Technique for the purpose of detecting digitally forged and morphed images.
• Successfully detected fake X-ray images, medical reports, documents and morphed images, thereby exploring Cyber-Security.
